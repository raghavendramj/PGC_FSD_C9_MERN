      To understand JavaScript (JS) promises, consider a blockbuster movie, such
      as Avengers. After its successful release, the fans of the movie asked the
      producer, Marvel Studios, if there will be a sequel. To resolve the fansâ€™
      queries, Marvel Studios asked the fans to follow the studio on Twitter.
      The studio promised the fans that it will let them know on Twitter if a
      sequel is finalised. If it is, then all the followers of Marvel Studios on
      Twitter will be notified. If, for some reason, the sequel cannot be
      produced, then the followers will nevertheless be notified.
