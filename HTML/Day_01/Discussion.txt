OSI Model -> Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) reference model


Sender :
---------------
Physical Layer
	-> data gets converted into a bitstream, a string of 0s and 1s. 11010100101110011
Data-Link Layer
	-> takes packets from the network layer and breaks them down into frames
Network Layer
	-> Sender:- breaks down the segments into smaller units called packets on the sender’s device.
	-> Receiver:- reassembles the packets into segments on the receiver’s device
Transport Layer
	-> Sender :- breaks down the data from the session layer into segments
	-> Receiver :- reassembles the segments into data on the receiving device
Session Layer
	-> the opening and the closing of communication is known as a session.
Presentation Layer
	-> Sender -> adds encryption at the sender’s end and decodes the encryption at the receiver’s end.
	-> Receiver :- translates the incoming data into a syntax that the application layer can understand. 
Application Layer
	-> is responsible for the protocols and data manipulation that the software relies on.
