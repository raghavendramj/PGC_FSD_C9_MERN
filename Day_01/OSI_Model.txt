Problem Statement:  If a person sends an email to another,
Communication Channel:

Sender :-
	->Application:- email
		-> Presentation:- Protocol< HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, TFTP, Telnet, SSH, SMTP>And(Email : SMTP ->Compressed Data)
			-> Session:- SessionCreation
				-> Transport:- Segmented <TCP/UDP>
					-> Network:- BrokenInToPackets
						-> DataLink: BrokenInToFrames
							-> Physical : BitstreamOf1sAnd0s
								-> 010100100100010010 
									-> Cables									

Receiver: - same layers but in an opposite order
		->from the cables
			-> 010100100100010010
				-> PHYSICAL : convert the bitstream from 1s and 0s into frames
					-> DATALINK: reassemble the frames into segments
						->  NETWORK: make segments out of the packets
							-> TRANSPORT: reassemble the segments into one piece of data
								-> SESSION : end the communication session
									-> PRESENTATION : remove the compression and pass the raw data
										-> APPLICATION: human-readable data along to the email  


Sender :-
APPLICATION		 :  the email application will pass the email message over to the application layer,
PRESENTATION	 :	which will pick a protocol<SMTP> and pass the data along to the presentation layer. The presentation layer will then compress the data,
	Protocol Choosen : <SMTP>
	Data is being compressed here.
SESSION	:- and then, it will hit the session layer, which will initialise the communication session.
TRANSPORTATION : The data will then hit the senderâ€™s transportation layer, where it will be segmented.
NETWORK : Those segments will then be broken down into packets at the network layer,
DATALINK : which will be further broken down into frames at the data link layer.
PHYSICAL : The data link layer will then deliver those frames to the physical layer, which will send them through a physical medium such as a cable after converting them into a bitstream of 1s and 0s.

NOTE:
Once the email reaches the receiver end computer through a physical medium such as a cable, the data will flow through the same layers but in an opposite order.

Receiver:  from the cables -> 
	-> PHYSICAL : convert the bitstream from 1s and 0s into frames
		-> DATALINK: reassemble the frames into segments
			->  NETWORK: make segments out of the packets
				-> TRANSPORT: reassemble the segments into one piece of data
					-> SESSION : end the communication session
						-> PRESENTATION : remove the compression and pass the raw data
							-> APPLICATION: human-readable data along to the email
